# Zig SDK

The **Zig SDK** is an
[MSBuild SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk)
that augments the .NET SDK with the ability to build Zig, C, and C++ projects.

With support for multiple programming languages, cross-compilation, NuGet
packaging, and more, the **Zig SDK** makes it trivial to author native
components as part of your .NET solution - without all the hassle that is
usually part and parcel of building and packaging native code.

This project offers the following packages:

* [Vezel.Zig.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Vezel.Zig.Sdk): Provides the
  MSBuild SDK and associated tasks.
